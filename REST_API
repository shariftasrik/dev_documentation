REST API :

For an API to be fully RESTful, it should be able to handle to 
all of the different routes (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import axios from "axios";

application.post("/", async (req,res) => {
    try{
        await axios.post("URL", body, config);
        res.sendStatus(201);
    }catch(error){
        res.status(404).send(error.response.data);
    }
})

QUS : "What makes an API RESTful?"

N Rules/Steps have to maintain to make an API RESTful.

Step 1 : HTTP

	It has to use standard HTTP Methods
		GET
		POST
		PUT
		PATCH
		DELETE
Step 2 : JSON

	It should have a standard data format that it response with Such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and this a response to calling the API and the response is given back to the client and RESTful API respond with some thing pretty standard like JSON. This is the representation part of the Representational State Transfer.

Resources are represented in a specific format like JSON, and that is sent in response to the client.

Step 3 : Client-Server

Step 4 : Statelessness

	Each request from the client, to the server, should contain all the information, that is needed to understand and process the request.
	
Step 5 : Resource-Based
	
	It is an API that is centered around resources and uses an URI (Unique Resource Identifier), also known as an URL(Unique Resource Locator).
